        We are committed to providing a work environment for all

Employees are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner and to show respect
for their co‐workers.While such behavior, depending on the circumstances, may not be severe or pervasive
enough to create a sexually hostile work environment, it can nonetheless make co‐workers
uncomfortable.  Accordingly, such behavior is inappropriate and may result in disciplinary
action regardless of whether it is unlawful.

        <h4>HOURS OF WORK, ATTENDANCE AND PUNCTUALITY</h4>
        
        Attendance is a key factor in your job performance.  Punctuality and regular attendance
are expected of all employees.  Excessive absences (whether excused or unexcused), tardiness or
leaving early is unacceptable.  If you are absent for any reason or plan to arrive late or leave
early, you must notify your supervisor and the office manager as far in advance as possible and
no later than one hour before the start of your scheduled work day.  In the event of an
emergency, you must notify your supervisor as soon as possible.
